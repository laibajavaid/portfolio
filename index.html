									<p>Welcome to my professional realm! As a front-end developer,  I bring a diverse skill set that extends beyond the lines of code. 
										I specialize in crafting seamless and engaging user interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and React Native.</p>
									<p>Beyond these languages, my expertise extends to Java, C, and C++, providing a holistic understanding of software development. 
										I navigate projects with precision using Git, BitBucket, and Gradle, ensuring seamless collaboration and code integration.</p>
									<p>I leverage developer tools like VS Code, Eclipse, Atom, and Figma to bring creative visions to life.  Committed to effective communication and documentation, 
										I use Trello, Slack, JIRA, and Microsoft Office. A collaborative spirit defines my approach, and I actively contribute to team success through pair 
										programming and participation in Scrum meetings.</p>
									<p>My journey continues as I immerse myself in mobile development with Flutter, expanding my knowledge. Use the arrows below to explore my completed projects, 
										each a testament to my dedication to excellence and continual learning. You can also view all <a href="https://github.com/laibajavaid" target=”_blank”>my work here</a>.</p>

									<h2>Etch-a-Sketch</h2>
									<p>I designed and developed an interactive pixel art application inspired by the timeless joy of an Etch-a-Sketch. With this application, 
										users can unleash their creativity by selecting any color for both the pen and background, offering a personalized canvas for pixel art creation.</p>
									<p>The rainbow feature adds a playful touch, covering each square on the grid with a random color for vibrant and dynamic compositions. 
										For added artistic depth, the application allows users to apply shading and lightening effects to their creations.</p>
									<p>The flexibility extends to grid selection, accommodating sizes up to 64 x 64 for intricate and detailed pixel art. Built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, 
										this application provides a user-friendly platform for pixel art enthusiasts to express their imagination with ease.</p>

									<h2>Weather App</h2>
									<p>I developed a user-friendly weather application designed to provide up-to-date weather information for any city worldwide. 
										Not only does tha app delivers accurate forecasts but also enhances user experience through dynamic design adaptations.</p>
									<p>Utilizing React hooks and conditions in conjunction with the Modern JavaScript Fetch API from <a href="http://openweathermap.org/" target=”_blank”>OpenWeatherMap</a>, 
										the app allows users to input a city and receive real-time weather information. What sets this project apart is its responsive design – the background image 
										dynamically changes based on the temperature of the searched location.</p>
									<p>Colder temperatures trigger a visually reflective background, creating an immersive experience that aligns with the weather conditions. Conversely, warmer climates 
										prompt a different background, ensuring the application not only provides functional data but also adapts its aesthetic to complement the user's environment. 
										This innovative feature showcases the synergy of functionality and design, adding an extra layer of engagement to the user's interaction with the weather app.</p>

									<h2>Notes App</h2>
									<p>I developed a versatile note-taking application that combines functionality with an intuitive user interface, leveraging a range of React features and 
										modern web technologies.Users can seamlessly write and save text for each note, with the application storing data in local storage for easy retrieval.</p>
									<p>The dynamic search functionality enables efficient organization, and a character limit feature ensures concise notes. Utilizing React components, props, useState(), 
										useEffect(), and hooks, the project showcases the power of React in handling HTML input with efficiency. The visual appeal is enhanced through Flexbox and Grid CSS 
										styles, offering a responsive and visually pleasing layout.</p>
									<p>Additionally, the incorporation of a dark and light mode adds a personalized touch to the user experience, providing flexibility in visual preferences. This project 
										marks my initiation into React JS, showcasing a blend of functional and aesthetic considerations in a user-friendly note-taking application.</p>
